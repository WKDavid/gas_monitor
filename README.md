Gas Monitor

Orginal Version: follows the tutorial for most part - fixed curve calculation
- example.py
- mq.py
- mcp3008

- gas.py --> same as example.py but showing all sensitivities

2nd Version: 3 sensors.... I just duplicated the calcualtions. The values are nonsense, but it works to see if all sensors are reading
- gas-2.py
- mq2.py
- mcp3008.py

3rd Version: no finished... working on cleaning code and adding correct calculations.
- mq3.py
